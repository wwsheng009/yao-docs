# Codebase Guide for Agents

## Project Overview

This repository contains a book or collection of thoughts on **AI Automated Programming** (AI 自动化编程).
The content is structured as a series of sequentially numbered "ideas" stored in markdown files.

## Structure

- **Root Directory**: `docs/AI/自动化编程/`
- **Files**: `idea{number}.md` (e.g., `idea1.md`, `idea2.md` ... `idea55.md`)
- **Content**: Each file contains one or more sections with Chinese numbering (e.g., 一, 二, ..., 三百...).

## Numbering System

The sections are numbered globally across the file series.

- **Start**: `idea1.md` begins with Section 1.
- **End**: `idea55.md` reaches Section 394 (approx).
- **Format**: `# 🧠 {Chinese Number}、{Title}`

## Key Sequence Checkpoints

- `idea19.md`: Ends at Section 75 (七十五)
- `idea20.md`: Covers Section 76-90 (七十六 - 九十)
- `idea21.md`: Starts at Section 91 (九十一)
- ...
- `idea50.md`: Covers Section 382-384
- `idea51.md`: Covers Section 385-388
- `idea52.md`: Starts at Section 389

## Maintenance Patterns

- **Adding Content**: Continue the sequence in a new file or append to the last one. Maintain the global numbering.
- **Formatting**:
  - Use H1 (`#`) for the main section title with the number.
  - Use H2 (`##`) or H3 (`###`) for subsections.
  - Use blockquotes (`>`) for emphasis.
  - Use `---` for separators between sections.
- **Images/Visuals**: Some files describe visual maps or charts (e.g., `idea53.md`, `idea55.md`).

## Known Issues

- `idea51.md` and `idea50.md` were previously suspected of duplication but verified to contain unique sequential content (382-384 vs 385-388).
- Ensure no files are accidentally deleted or duplicated, as the numbering is continuous.
